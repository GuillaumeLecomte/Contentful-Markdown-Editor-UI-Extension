Small Markdown Editor as Contentful UI Extension

### [SimpleMDE](https://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor "SimpleMDE") as Markdown Editor
Easy to integrate and customize. I added a Save button which triggers Contentful SDK SaveValue-Function. 
Plus, a small Vue component uses [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown "Showdown MD to HTML Converter") for converting MD to HTML.

In this editor you insert keys from [Phraseapp](https://phraseapp.com/ "Phraseapp.com") Localisation tool which then later will be replaced by the actual translation by a backend. SO it is easier for different purposes to have the MD to HTM Conversion be done at once by Vue instance.
